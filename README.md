# Sample Code from Rust Programming Full Course - Learn Rust in 2024

This repo contains the sample code from the [Rust Programming Full Course - Learn Rust in 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ_J9WH6CGk), by [Bek Brace](https://www.youtube.com/@BekBrace).

It's roughly the same code as in the video, but I've made some minor changes to play around with different ways of doing things. You'd be far better off watching the video to get the full (and correct) content.

The video is available on YouTube at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ_J9WH6CGk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ_J9WH6CGk).
