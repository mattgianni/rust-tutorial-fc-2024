# Sample Code from Rust Programming Full Course - Learn Rust in 2024

This repository contains sample code from the [Rust Programming Full Course - Learn Rust in 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ_J9WH6CGk) by [Bek Brace](https://www.youtube.com/@BekBrace).

The code is similar to what's demonstrated in the video, with some minor modifications to explore different approaches. Watching the video is recommended for a comprehensive understanding.

## Update

I've added examples from [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols, with contributions from the Rust Community.

> Note: These examples are sourced from an interactive version of the book hosted at Brown University, [Experiment: Improving the Rust Book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu). Some content may differ from the original book.
